What do I put in the dishwasher? What are the symbols I find on clothes to wash them?""")

Our reels want to not only explain but also for them to be a source of debate among users and inspiration to each other.

    The rewards we will use both in stories and for reels/posts etc. 
    They are: self (content that provides useful information that can enrich users' personal experience. ), relatability(content that makes us think ‚Äúomg he's talking about me.‚Äù) and social (content that creates appreciation for users by users themselves).
